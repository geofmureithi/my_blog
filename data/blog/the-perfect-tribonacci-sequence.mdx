## Not Fibonacci, Tribonacci

A Fibonacci sequence function in python below:

```python
def fib(n):
 a,b = 1,1
 for i in range(n-1):
    a,b = b,a+b
 return a
print(fib(5))
```

A Tribonacci sequences occur in several ways:

| a   | b   | c   | Sequence                                          |
| --- | --- | --- | ------------------------------------------------- |
| 0   | 0   | 1   | 0, 1, 1, 1, 2, 4, 7, 13, 24, 44, 81, 149, …       |
| 1   | 1   | 1   | 1, 1, 1, 3, 5, 9, 17, 31, 57, 105, 193, 355, …    |
| 0   | 1   | 0   | 0, 1, 0, 1, 2, 3, 6, 11, 20, 37, 68, 125, 230, …  |
| 3   | 1   | 3   | 3, 1, 3, 7, 11, 21, 39, 71, 131, 241, 443, 815, … |
| -1  | 2   | 2   | -1, 2, 2, 3, 7, 12, 22, 41, 75, 138, 254, 467, …  |

Now, Apart from creating a function that can handle any sequence, the function was also supposed to calculate huge numbers.
I decided to start with a simple if loop.

## Simplest Approach

```python
def fib3(n):
# maximum recussion error for 4000
 if n == 0:
    return 1
 elif n == 1:
    return 1
 elif n == 2:
    return 1
 else:
    return fib3(n-1) + fib3(n-2) + fib3(n-3)
```

This worked for small Tribonacci calculations, but had a maximum recussion error.
My second instinct was to memorize.

## Memorize

```python
memory = {0:1, 1:1, 2:1}

def fib3_alternative(n):
# maximum recussion error for 4000; Avoided by building up results in memory
 if not n in memory:
    memory[n] = fib3_alternative(n-1) + fib3_alternative(n-2) + fib3_alternative(n-3)
 return memory[n]
```

This would work but only if I build the memory slowly:

Building the memory

```python
#to avoid maximum recussion errors in python, we have to smartly build our fib3 memory
fib3_alternative(40)
fib3_alternative(100)
fib3_alternative(300)
fib3_alternative(700)
fib3_alternative(1000)
fib3_alternative(1500)
fib3_alternative(2000)
fib3_alternative(2500)
fib3_alternative(3000)
fib3_alternative(3500)
print("Fib3_alternative for 4000 is {}".format(fib3_alternative(4000)))
I had to create something that would work for all sequences, and must have no complicated methods.
```

After several times of trial and error, It came to me:

### Queueing

```python
def fib3_best(n):
 queue = [1, 1, 1]
 for i in xrange(n-2):
    queue = queue[1:] + [sum(queue)]
 return queue[-1]
print ("Fib3_best for 4000 is {}".format(fib3_best(4000)))
```

This works like a charm! You can change queue to whichever sequence you feel suits you.
