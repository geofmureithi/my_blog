## Overview

## Not handling exceptions?

Once in a while as a programmer you meet difficult times, be it time-limits, shitty code and much more. It is not advisable to suppress errors. Every programmer should handle exceptions. But what do you do in those times where it proves difficult to approach things rationally in the now and then?

## Handling problematic imports

Import the module with `fuckit`

```python
import fuckit

#import problematic_module
fuckit('problematic_module')
problematic_module.a_function()
```

## Class with Errors

As a `@decorator`

```python
@fuckit
class Person:

    AnotherName = 'Sue Ann'

    def __init__(self):
        self.FirstName = 'Tom'
        self.LastName = 'Sneed'

    def get_name(self):
        return self.FirstName + ' ' + self.LastName

@fuckit
class Employee(Person):

    def __init__(self):
        self.empnum = 'abc123'

    def get_emp(self):
        print self.AnotherName
        return self.FirstName + ' ' + 'abc'


# The lines below work just fine

x = Person()
y = Employee()

print x.get_name()
print y.get_emp()
```

## Function with errors

As a `@decorator`

```python
@fuckit
def printme( str ):
    something_wrong # No Exception
    printme("My string")
```

## Using it in a ‘with’ situation:

```python
def printme( str ):
    with fuckit:
        printme("It will never be an error")
   #Similar to
    try:
        printme("It will never be an error")
    except Exception:
    pass
```

Keep in mind that the decorator form of fuckit can’t stop syntax errors

Go on to Github and view the module https://github.com/ajalt/fuckitpy or run :

```
$ pip install fuckit
```
